#find a random spot in the USA

#First method: generate a random latitude and longitude within a rough area encompassing 
#   the united states (or maybe the world), and make sure that its valid, if not generate 
#   a new one.

#Second method: generate ALL of the valid long/lat in the US and use that to pick a
#   random one; but there are probably millions depending on the resoltion I choose.
